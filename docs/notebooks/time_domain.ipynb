    "# Large Scale Time-Domain Analysis with LSDB & Nested\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases the usage of LSDB and Nested to do large scale time-domain analysis. We build a dataset from multiple input surveys, and select a subset of interesting objects from large sections of the sky. We compute periodograms (or any other function of interest to the user!) on our objects of interest and conclude with working with their spectra."
