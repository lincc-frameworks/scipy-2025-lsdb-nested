## Abstract
The exponential growth of large survey catalogs has introduced new challenges for astronomical datasets. Our session showcases the LSDB framework, an analysis framework built upon hierarchically sharded spatial partitioned data with Parquet for efficient cross-matching and analysis. Weâ€™ll showcase nested-pandas/nested-dask for time-domain and spectral data, and highlight real-world applications across wide-sky datasets, with the nod toward the upcoming Rubin Survey.
